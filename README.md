## Key Components

### Query Generation
We break down each claim into verifiable facts, using each as a web search query to retrieve up to 10 relevant results.

### Impact Assessment
We analyze claim content to:
- Predict a societal impact score on a scale of 1-10
- Provide detailed justification for impact scores

### Domain Authority Metrics
For each evidence link, we evaluate domain authority using:

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|--------|
| Domain Age | 0-âˆž |
| TLD Score | 1-10 |
| Page Rank | 1-10 |
| Bias Rating | 1-5 |
| Factual Rating | 1-6 |
| Credibility Rating | 1-4 |

These metrics are aggregated per claim, sourced from:
- WHOIS
- Open PageRank
- SSL
- mediabiasfactcheck.com

### Knowledge Store
- Uses trafilatura for evidence link scraping
- Stores scraped text in JSON format
- Creates individual JSON files per claim containing all evidence
