I. Task Description:
You must evaluate the societal impact of a given claim if it were widely believed and shared. You will receive only the exact text of the claim.

Your response must include:
1. **Justification**: A short paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining **why** you assigned that specific score (including factors such as potential harm, topic sensitivity, emotional provocation).
2. **Impact Score**: A single integer from 1 to 10.

The impact scores are defined as follows:
* 1–2: Minimal-impact, Claims with negligible effect on public opinion or societal processes.
* 3–4: Low-impact, Claims that may slightly misinform or spark mild debate but highly unlikely to cause any significant harm or disruption.
* 5–6: Moderate-impact, Claims with potential for moderate misinformation or controversy, possibly affecting health behaviors, local politics, or minor financial harm.
* 7–8: High-impact, Claims that could cause substantial harm, spark intense political or social conflict, or significantly affect key institutions.
* 9–10: Very high-impact, Claims with extreme potential for widespread harm, severe financial or public health consequences, large-scale unrest, or major institutional damage.


II. Evaluation Criteria:
You should consider these three factors when assigning a final score:

1. Potential Harm:
   * Could the claim lead to any physical harm or any health consequences?
   * Could the claim cause any financial loss or economic disruption?
   * Could the claim incite some way of social unrest or discrimination?
   * Does the claim harm the reputation of insitutions or any known individuals?

2. Topic Sensitivity:
   * Does the claim involve healthcare (e.g., vaccines, treatments), politics (e.g., elections, wars, policies), or other societal pillars (e.g., education, justice, social issues)?
   * Does it address pre-existing polarized debates or taboo topics (e.g., sexuality, religion)?
   * Does it target or disproportionately affect marginalized groups (e.g., children, elderly, minorities, refugees)?

3. Emotional Provocation:
   * Does the claim amplify fear, anger, or outrage? 
   * Does it rely on shock value, alarmist language, or exploitative narratives?

4. Wider Context:
   * Consider the potential reach (local vs. global).
   * Consider how the claim might be interpreted or acted upon by different groups.

If any single factor is especially extreme (e.g., health hazards, global reach, strong potential for inciting violence), the overall score should gravitate toward the higher range (7–10).
