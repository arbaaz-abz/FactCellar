I. Task Description:
You are tasked with evaluating the potential impact of a claim. You will be given:
1. The exact text of the claim
2. The context or source where it was made (e.g., Instagram post, Tweet, interview, debate, etc.), if available
3. The speaker who made the claim, if available
4. The date on which it was made, if available

You must output:
1. **Justification**: A short paragraph explaining **why** you assigned that specific score (including factors such as speaker’s influence, audience reach, potential for harm, sensationalism, veracity—even if known).
2. **Impact Score**: A single integer from 1 to 10.

The impact scores are defined as follows:
- 1–2 (Minimal-impact)
- 3–4 (Low-impact)
- 5–6 (Moderate-impact)
- 7–8 (High-impact)
- 9–10 (Very high-impact)

II. Guidelines:
1. Speaker’s Influence: 
   * Consider how well-known or credible the speaker is. A high-profile public figure (politician, celebrity, major influencer) likely has a broader audience and can cause greater impact.
   * If the speaker has a small following or is relatively unknown, the potential spread and impact might be lower, unless the claim is picked up by larger media outlets or platforms.
2. Platform & Audience Reach: 
   * A claim made on widely used social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) can either fizzle out or has a chance to reach millions. 
   * However prominent interviews and debates on media channels, such as presidential debates, can reach a wider audience.
   * A claim made in a local event or less popular channel may have a narrower audience, thus lower impact.
3. Content of the Claim: 
   * Assess how sensational or emotionally charged the claim is. Consider whether it touches on sensitive or highly controversial topics (e.g., health, politics, finance, social issues), as these often gain traction faster.
   * Wild and unrealistic claims are more likely to be shared and believed, thus higher impact.
   * "Making an educated guess on the veracity" often helps as false claims are more likely to become viral.
4. Timing and Current Events:
   * If the claim aligns with ongoing events or popular trends, it might spread more quickly.
   * A claim made during a crisis or high-profile event can amplify its potential impact.
5. Potential for Harm:
   * Could the claim lead to any physical harm or any health consequences?
   * Could the claim cause economic disruption or financial loss?
   * Could the claim incite some way of social unrest, chaos or discrimination? 
   * Does the claim harm the reputation of institutions or any known individuals?
   * The possibilites are endless, so be creative and think outside the box.

III. Examples:
Example 1:
Input:
Claim: "My homemade cookies are the best in the neighborhood."
Source: a personal Facebook post
Speaker: Jane Smith
Date: January 5, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "The speaker is unknown outside her small friend circle. The claim isn’t controversial or harmful. Likelihood of significant spread or harm is negligible.",
   "Impact Score": 1
}

Example 2:
Input:
Claim: "The new coffee shop on Main Street is overrated."
Source: comment on a blog
Speaker: @CoffeeCritic101
Date: February 2, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "The platform is niche and local; the claim is an opinion rather than a statement of fact. Minimal audience, minimal potential for causing broader harm.",
   "Impact Score": 2
}

Example 3:
Input:
Claim: "People who wear yellow socks are luckier than those who don’t."
Source: a tweet
Speaker: @LuckySocksEnthusiast
Date: March 1, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "Mildly odd or quirky claim. Although it could spread if it caught on as a funny meme, it's unlikely to harm or seriously misinform. The speaker probably has a small following, and the tweet is not strongly tied to any controversial topic.",
   "Impact Score": 3
}

Example 4:
Input:
Claim: "All cats are secretly plotting world domination."
Source: a podcast
Speaker: Ryan George
Date: April 10, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "Presented humorously; very low credibility and mostly a joke. Unlikely to cause meaningful harm, but could be slightly sensational in a comedic sense.",
   "Impact Score": 4
}

Example 5:
Input:
Claim: "Taking daily cold showers guarantees weight loss without exercise or diet changes."
Source: Instagram Reel
Speaker: @josuwabb_
Date: May 5, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "Health-related claims can influence people's habits. Moderate-size following could lead some to take the claim seriously. Might become sensational if there isn't any research to back the claim. Potential for harm (people might neglect proper nutrition/exercise), but not necessarily widespread.",
   "Impact Score": 5
}

Example 6:
Input:
Claim: "Our city's mayor secretly supported a policy 10 years ago to cut funding for public schools and redirect it to private developers—something he’s desperately hiding from voters now."
Source: a forum (CityTalks.com)
Speaker: @TruthSeeker2025
Date: June 12, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "The claim directly targets the mayor’s credibility during a heated election season, accusing him of prioritizing private interests over public education. The sensational nature of the claim, tying the mayor to controversial policies—could sway undecided voters, though its reach is likely limited to local circles without mainstream media pickup."
   "Impact Score": 6
}

Example 7:
Input:
Claim: "A new virus is spreading fast in our region and the government is covering it up."
Source: a video shared on TikTok
Speaker: @mora.jello
Date: July 20, 2025

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "Health/cover-up claims can generate fear and distrust. Large social media following can further increase the likelihood of widespread sharing. Potential harm if people panic or ignore official guidance.",
   "Impact Score": 7
}

Example 8:
Input:
Claim: "Insurance companies secretly removed fire insurance coverage for millions of homeowners in California three months before the devastating wildfires of 2024, leaving families without financial protection."
Source: a report
Speaker: Anonymous whistleblower
Date: September 12, 2024

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "This conspiracy claim, backed by an anonymous whistleblower and published on a credible platform, would spark outrage and distrust in the insurance industry. The timing, just after a catastrophic event, amplifies its emotional and financial impact on affected homeowners. The potential for lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and public backlash makes it highly impactful.",
   "Impact Score": 8
}

Example 9:
Input:
Claim: "I see the disinfectant, where it knocks COVID-19 out in a minute. Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? It would be interesting to check that."
Source: An address at the White House
Speaker: Donald Trump (45th U.S. President)
Date: April 23, 2020

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "As U.S. President, Trump’s remarks during a national press briefing carried immense authority. The suggestion of injecting disinfectants, though speculative, was widely interpreted as serious, leading to public confusion and dangerous actions. The claim spread globally, prompting health warnings and causing harm during a pandemic.",
   "Impact Score": 9
}

Example 10:
Input:
Claim: "Starting tomorrow, a nationwide 30-day lockdown will be enforced to contain the spread of a new, highly contagious COVID-19 variant. All non-essential businesses must close, and citizens are required to stay home except for emergencies."
Source: live televised address
Speaker: Boris Johnson
Date: January 15, 2024

Output(JSON):
{
   "Justification": "Delivered during a live televised address by the PM, this announcement carries the highest level of authority and reach. The claim directly impacts millions of citizens, causing immediate economic disruption, panic buying, and public anxiety. Such a declaration would dominate global news cycles and influence international responses.",
   "Impact Score": 10
}
